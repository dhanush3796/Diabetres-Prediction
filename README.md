# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes using various health-related attributes based on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The notebook applies machine learning techniques such as data preprocessing, visualization, and classification models to solve the binary classification task.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the complete workflow.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and usage instructions.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a machine learning model that can predict the onset of diabetes in patients based on diagnostic measurements like:
- Glucose level
- BMI
- Age
- Insulin
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Number of Pregnancies
- Diabetes Pedigree Function

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which is publicly available from Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Features:**
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age

**Target:**
- Outcome (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

To run this notebook, make sure you have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:
